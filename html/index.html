  Release 4:
-HTML5 semantic tags are used to help present a clarity of thought and orderedness to a given web page. The most useful tag is the one that best suits the purpose of the site, e.g. if writing a blog, one might use the <aritcle> tag as the best semantic descriptor of the content.
-The browser displays content from top to bottom, or put another way, from parent to child elements.
-Mastering snippets was an invaluable tool to add towards my mastery of sublime and general workflow. Beginning to understand the distinction between static and dynamic web pages was also very enlightening.
-I think I still struggle with thinking from the perspective of writing in code, which often leaves me running back to add the end of tags, or insert elements where I should have known they'd belong to begin with. One of the most interesting things about coding as its own language, is that it offers a new grammar to grapple with and to try and start expressing ideas in. I'm not quite there yet, but I look forward to the challange!
