- reflection:
  - watching a tutorial video on Youtube was good for helping to get Jquery installed and a basic understanding of how to incorporate the syntax with HTML. I was at a coffee shop, and my studying got disrupted, so my time wasn't used particularly effectively. In fututre, I would prefer to be in a quieter area where I could more easily focus on the material and perhaps find a more comprehensive source.
