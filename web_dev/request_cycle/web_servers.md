2) What are some of the key design philosophies of the Linux operating system?

Linux, as a Unix based operating system, "emphasizes building simple, short, clear, modular, and extensible code that can be easily maintained and repurposed by developers other than its creators. The Unix philosophy favors composability as opposed to monolithic design." -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy

I think the composability and modularity are good aspects to focus on when trying to understand the underltying intent of a Unix based system. The OS can be conceived of as a mosaic stain-glass widnow, rather than a vast clear pane.

3) In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

A VPS is a computer created on server (or I suppose it could also be created locally if you had the right system setup). It functions as a normal computer might, but does not occupy the same physical space that a local computer does, nor does it have the same risks associated with needing to mainting its files and general hardware. It's great because it allows a programmer to work in a no-stakes enviroenment as well as work on a different system (windows, linux, mac) and perhaps also systems with different processing needs (So you could mimic a mobile environment or something to that effect).

4) Optional bonus question: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?

You can modify the actual OS of the system, and thus corrupt an essential function for your computer. Yikes.
