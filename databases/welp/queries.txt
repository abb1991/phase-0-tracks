2) You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses INNER JOIN users ON users.id = businesses.id INNER JOIN reviews on reviews.id =users.id;
1|Mommy What Will I Look Like?|1|Alex|Bills|1|3|I LOVE THIS PLACE!|1|1
2|Bluth Homes|2|Emme|Friedberg|2|4|BOMB!|2|2
3|GOBIAS industries|3|Zaki|Arian|3|5|SUPER RAD!!!!!!!!|3|3

3) There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT businesses.name, users.first_name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment FROM businesses INNER JOIN users ON users.id = businesses.id INNER JOIN reviews on reviews.id =users.id;

4) How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

sqlite> SELECT * FROM businesses INNER JOIN users ON users.id = businesses.id INNER JOIN reviews on reviews.id =users.id WHERE businesses.name="GOBIAS industries";
3|GOBIAS industries|3|Zaki|Arian|3|5|SUPER RAD!!!!!!!!|3|3
